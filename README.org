* =Emacs Configuration=
#+HTML: </div>

* Overview
This is my personal =GNU/Emacs= config. I use emacs for the most time on
=Linux=, but it works on =Windows 10= as well. I am using =GNU/Emacs 27.2=
and it works without any problems. I want to upgrade to =GNU/Emacs
28.0.50=, but I canâ€™t compile my config correctly.

This config is maintained and will get updated in the future. There
could be some major changes with one commit, because of a really
boring lessons.

I use this config mostly for org-mode and programming. For
programming, I use LSP and nothing else.

* Installation
First clone this repository and install all the system dependencies
(installation steps below). And after that, you have to change the
variables =dk/user-system-base-path=, =dk/org-roam-dir= and
=dk/org-journal-dir= in the =init.el= file to a path that emacs should
pick as it's default directory.

If you install this configuration for the first time, it could throw
some errors. If this happens, just restart emacs a few times and after
2-3 restarts, everything should be fine.

** Manjaro
The installation on Linux is very simple. Just execute the following
command:

#+begin_src sh
$ sudo pacman -Syyu && sudo pacman -S sqlite3 aspell asple-de rustup texlive
#+end_src

** Windows 10
Install GNU Emacs from the official mirror. Preferably install the
latest Release: version 27.1. Before starting GNU Emacs, install MSYS2
to easily manage external dependencies. Install it to C:\msys64. Then
add C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\ to the PATH.

Then execute the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
$ pacman -S git
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-sqlite3
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-aspell
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-aspell-de
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-rustup
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-miktex
$ pip install python-language-server[all]
$ pip install pyls-black pyls-isort pyls-mypy
#+end_src
