* =Emacs Configuration=
#+HTML: </div>

* Overview
This is my personal =GNU/Emacs= config. I use emacs for the most time on
=Linux=, but it works on =Windows 10= as well. I am using =GNU/Emacs 27.2=
and it works without any problems. I want to upgrade to =GNU/Emacs
28.0.50=, but I canâ€™t compile my config correctly.

This config is maintained and will get updated in the future. There
could be some major changes with one commit, because of a really
boring lessons.

I use this config mostly for org-mode and programming. For
programming, I use LSP and nothing else.

* Installation
First clone this repository and install all the system dependencies
(installation steps below). On the first startup, emacs will prompt
you to set some default directories. They will be saved in the file
=.emacs-config-vars= and are stored in your home directory. If you ever
want to change the paths, you can do this by interactively calling
=dk/reset-config-variables=. This functionality resides in the file
=~/.emacs.d/modules/custom-set-variables.el= and can be tweaked there a
bit. 

If you install this configuration for the first time, it could throw
some errors. If this happens, just restart emacs a few times and after
2-3 restarts, everything should be fine.

** Manjaro
The installation on Linux is very simple. Just execute the following
command:

#+begin_src sh
$ sudo pacman -Syyu && sudo pacman -S aspell aspell-de rustup texlive
#+end_src

** Windows 10
Install =GNU/Emacs= from the official mirror. Preferably install the
latest Release: version 27.1. Alternatively, you can use the official
Microsoft package manager: =winget=.

#+begin_src sh
$ winget install emacs
#+end_src

Before starting emacs, install =MSYS2=
to easily manage external dependencies. Install it to =C:\msys64=. Then
add =C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\= to the =PATH=.

Then execute the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
$ pacman -S git
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-sqlite3
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-aspell
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-aspell-de
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-rustup
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-miktex
$ pip install python-language-server[all]
$ pip install pyls-black pyls-isort pyls-mypy
#+end_src

* Update
To update and get the newest config, you just have to pull it from
github by calling:

#+begin_src sh
$ git pull origin master
#+end_src
